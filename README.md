# What's this?
A Discord bot I made for the logging of my pinned notes/shopping lists (for personal use). You can use this bot to handle server pins.

This project is open to suggestions and improvements; feel free to make a pull request!
# Usage
You can [invite the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1133351003803091094&permissions=414464732352&scope=bot) or you can run it locally...
